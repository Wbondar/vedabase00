#Here is little explanation:
If you got to this Quartz website 
(http://qz.com/398124/if-you-are-a-mosquito-magnet-its-likely-your-kids-will-be-too/), 
and hover above different paragraph there is a plus icon on the right. 
After clicking paragraph is highlighted and annotation block on right 
side appears.

We will need similar functionality for new vedabase.com, where every 
paragraph have unique id and should have attach similar menu, where 
users can bookmark, share, propose category, etc....

#Our requirements:
- has to work on desktops
- has to work on touch devices
- working in different screen widths (large screen just show block, in 
smaller it can slide main content to make space for block)
- should be possible to use on chapter page (e.g.: 
https://editor.vedabase.com/en/bg/2/chapter-view/) (so it may have 
hundreds paragraphs)
