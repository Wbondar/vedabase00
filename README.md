#Vedabase v2 :: Paragraph Menu
If you got to this Quartz website 
(http://qz.com/398124/if-you-are-a-mosquito-magnet-its-likely-your-kids-will-be-too/), 
and hover above different paragraph there is a plus icon on the right. 
After clicking paragraph is highlighted and annotation block on right 
side appears.

We need paragraph menu for new version of vedabase.com, where where users can bookmark, share, propose category, etc.... for specific paragraph.

#Our requirements:
- has to work on desktops
- has to work on touch devices
- working in different screen widths (large screen just show block, in 
smaller it can slide main content to make space for block)
- should be possible to use on chapter page (e.g.: 
https://editor.vedabase.com/en/bg/2/chapter-view/) (so it may have 
hundreds paragraphs)
