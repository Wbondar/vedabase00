#Vedabase v2 :: Paragraph Menu

We need paragraph menu for new version of vedabase.com, where where users can bookmark, share, propose category, etc.... for specific paragraph.

Paragraph menu should appear in similar style as annotation block qz.com.

#Our requirements:
- has to work on desktops
- has to work on touch devices
- working in different screen widths (large screen just show block, in 
smaller it can slide main content to make space for block)
- should be possible to use on chapter page (e.g.: 
https://editor.vedabase.com/en/bg/2/chapter-view/) (so it may have 
hundreds paragraphs)
